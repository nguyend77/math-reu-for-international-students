# Math REU Programs for International Students
REUs (Research Experience for Undergraduates) are summer programs where college students conduct research with faculty mentors, offering hands-on experience, skill-building, career insights, proving extremely helpful for exploring graduate school and industry work environment, deepening science understanding, and building strong relationships. These intense, often funded, 6-10 week programs are crucial for undergraduates who are considering a career path in STEM research.  

Due to the restrictive funding requirements from the NSF (National Science Foundation), many REUs only accept applications who are U.S. citizens and permanent residents. This poses a challenge to international students with F-1 visa, limiting their chances of getting into scientific research. Some students are able to find funded programs at their home institution, however at many small liberal art colleges, there might be less resources to facilitate such advanced STEM research.  

This repository contains a listing of some, but not all, REUs aimed at mathematics students which international students can apply to. Note that many of these programs require that students must be enrolled at U.S. schools, so students from other countries might not be eligible. The application deadline range from January to Febuary each year.
